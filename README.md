# RESTful Guestbook Demo

Welcome! This is a simple Spring Boot Guestbook application deployed live on AWS, demonstrating a basic CI/CD pipeline.

**Live URL:** [http://guestbook-env.eba-yqpn5naf.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/](http://guestbook-env.eba-yqpn5naf.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/)

**Extra Credit Opportunities:**

1.  **Sign & Comment:**
    * Sign the guestbook using the REST API instructions on the main page.
    * Visit your personal guest page (click your name on the list).
    * Leave **two** comments on your page using the REST API instructions provided there.

2.  **Contribute via Pull Request:**
    * Suggest a small enhancement or fix for the application (e.g., improving styling, adding a feature, fixing a typo).
    * Create a **Pull Request (PR)** against the main GitHub repository with your proposed changes.

## How This App Demonstrates CI/CD

This Java Spring Boot application is a live example of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). Here's what happens when you push changes to the `origin/main` branch:

- **Local Changes:** You develop and push your code locally.
- **GitHub Actions:** Your push triggers a GitHub Actions workflow.
- **Maven Build:** The workflow runs Maven to build the application.
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk Deployment:** The built app is automatically deployed to AWS Elastic Beanstalk, updating the live web app.

Every update flows from code commit to live deployment without manual interventionâ€”showing the true power of CI/CD!
